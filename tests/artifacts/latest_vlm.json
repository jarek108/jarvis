The helmet is centrally positioned within a circular, high-tech interface that resembles a heads-up display (HUD) or targeting system.\n\nKey visual elements include:\n- A glowing blue, metallic helmet with a sleek, angular design.\n- Bright, glowing green eyes that give it an intense, focused look.\n- Red accents on the sides of the helmet, possibly representing earpieces or sensors.\n- A circular frame surrounding the helmet, composed of concentric rings with glowing blue lines and markings, suggesting a digital or scanning interface.\n- The overall color scheme is dominated by shades of blue and black, creating a dark, high-tech, and cybernetic atmosphere.\n\nThe image is likely a logo or icon for a game, app, or digital platform related to Iron Man or a similar sci-fi theme.",
